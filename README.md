# Emergency Food Finder

I was going to design a project to generate food leftovers in food banks in Seattle, and people can submit a form online based on the food they have and request delivery. However, during the process of looking for a food bank API, it's hard to find what I want. 
The APIs I saw are outdated and not working anymore. After that, I moved to some new ideas. I found data about Emergency Food and Meals Seattle and King County, and I think I can do a map to help people to locate the food center through longitude, latitude and zipcode inputs. 

Here is the API I found:
 (1) Google Map API
 (2) Emergency Food and Meals Seattle and King County https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Emergency-Food-and-Meals-Seattle-and-King-County/kkzf-ntnu
 
This website is designed to help people in need find emergency food or meals more quickly and more efficiently. Traditional mapping websites, like Google Maps, may have a lot of distracting information. For this website I designed, users can input their zip code, and the website will show up the emergency food information based on the input zip code.
